Homework from 10-8-15


What I'm currently struggling with:

The HEADER- Made position relative/absolute changes and getting closer. The index.html file is the main fle to use. hearder.html was experimental.

Positioning- Elements are causing other elements to move and I'm not always understanding why leading to a complete cluster sometimes with positioning.

Having clean CSS- Again I fell into a neverending rabbit hole of having too much css and not knowing what was doing what.

Bottom 4 pics- not quite sure why there's space in between them

Feel ok about- the Middle section
