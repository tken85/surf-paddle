Homework from 10-8-15


What I'm currently struggling with:

The HEADER- Several attempts were taken with the header  (see commented out portion in index.html and the attempt in header.html which worked ok there but when brought over to index.html got completely messed up. 

Positioning- Elements are causing other elements to move and I'm not always understanding why leading to a complete cluster sometimes with positioning.

Having clean CSS- Again I fell into a neverending rabbit hole of having too much css and not knowing what was doing what. 

Bottom 4 pics- not quite sure why there's space in between them

Feel ok about- the Middle section
